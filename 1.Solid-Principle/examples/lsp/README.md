# The Journey Through Liskov Substitution Principle

Welcome to an adventure in understanding one of the most fundamental yet subtle principles of object-oriented design. This guide will take you through a journey of discovery, mistakes, and enlightenment about the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

## ðŸ“š Chapter 1: The Basics
Start with understanding what LSP means and why it matters:
- [`1_introduction/README.md`](1_introduction/README.md) - The foundation concepts
- [`1_introduction/SimpleShape.java`](1_introduction/SimpleShape.md) - Your first encounter with LSP

## ðŸš« Chapter 2: Common Pitfalls
Learn from others' mistakes:
- [`2_common_mistakes/README.md`](2_common_mistakes/README.md) - Understanding what not to do
- [`2_common_mistakes/RectangleSquare.java`](2_common_mistakes/RectangleSquare.java) - The classic Rectangle-Square problem
- [`2_common_mistakes/BirdOstrich.java`](2_common_mistakes/BirdOstrich.java) - The flying bird dilemma

## ðŸ›  Chapter 3: The Fix
Discover how to fix common LSP violations:
- [`3_solutions/README.md`](3_solutions/README.md) - Patterns for fixing LSP violations
- [`3_solutions/ShapeHierarchy.java`](3_solutions/ShapeHierarchy.java) - Proper shape implementations
- [`3_solutions/BirdHierarchy.java`](3_solutions/BirdHierarchy.java) - Correct bird abstractions

## ðŸš— Chapter 4: Real World Example
See LSP in action with a practical example:
- [`4_real_world/README.md`](4_real_world/README.md) - Applying LSP in real scenarios
- [`4_real_world/vehicles/`](4_real_world/vehicles/) - The Vehicle hierarchy example

## ðŸŽ“ Chapter 5: Advanced Concepts
Dive deeper into LSP:
- [`5_advanced/README.md`](5_advanced/README.md) - Advanced LSP concepts
- [`5_advanced/ContractExample.java`](5_advanced/ContractExample.java) - Understanding contracts
- [`5_advanced/Invariants.java`](5_advanced/Invariants.java) - Working with invariants

## ðŸ§ª Chapter 6: Testing
Learn how to verify LSP compliance:
- [`6_testing/README.md`](6_testing/README.md) - Testing strategies
- [`6_testing/LSPTests.java`](6_testing/LSPTests.java) - Test examples

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference
- [Decision Making Framework](LSP_Guide.md)
- [Common Violations Cheatsheet](LSPViolations.md)
- [Best Practices Summary](LSPFixedExamples.md)

Start your journey with Chapter 1 and progress through each chapter to build a solid understanding of LSP. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and challenges gradually.

Remember: LSP is not just about making code work - it's about making code that's reliable, maintainable, and true to its promises.
