## Introduction
SOLID is a set of five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental guidelines in object-oriented design.

## Single Responsibility Principle
> "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

### Basic Understanding
- Each class should focus on doing one thing well
- A class should have only one job or responsibility
- If a class handles multiple responsibilities, it becomes coupled and harder to maintain

### Real-world Analogy
Think of a restaurant:
- Chef: Cooks food
- Waiter: Serves customers
- Cashier: Handles payments
Each person has a single, well-defined responsibility.

### Code Example
See [SRP Example](./examples/srp/)

## Open/Closed Principle
> "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."

### Basic Understanding
- You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code
- Use abstractions and interfaces to allow for extensibility
- Protect existing code from breaking changes

### Real-world Analogy
Think of a smartphone:
- Base phone remains unchanged
- New functionality added through apps
- No need to modify phone's core system

### Code Example
See [OCP Example](./examples/ocp/)

## Liskov Substitution Principle
> "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application."

### Basic Understanding
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Derived classes must honor contracts of base classes
- Behavior of the program should not change when using derived classes

### Real-world Analogy
Think of electric cars:
- A Tesla can be used wherever a regular car is expected
- It follows all driving rules and behaviors of regular cars
- It might add features but doesn't break basic car expectations

### Code Example
See [LSP Example](./examples/lsp/)

## Interface Segregation Principle
> "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use."

### Basic Understanding
- Keep interfaces small and focused
- Don't force classes to implement methods they don't need
- Better to have many specific interfaces than one general-purpose interface

### Real-world Analogy
Think of a restaurant menu:
- Separate menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
- Specific menus for vegetarian, vegan options
- Instead of one large, confusing menu

### Code Example
See [ISP Example](./examples/isp/)

## Dependency Inversion Principle
> "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."

### Basic Understanding
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- High-level modules define interfaces
- Low-level modules implement these interfaces

### Real-world Analogy
Think of electrical outlets:
- Devices depend on standard outlet interfaces
- Not concerned with how electricity is generated
- Can swap power sources without changing devices

### Code Example
See [DIP Example](./examples/dip/)

## Interview Questions

### 1. What are the SOLID principles, and why are they important?
**Answer:** SOLID principles are five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software:
- Single Responsibility: Classes have one job
- Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- Interface Segregation: Keep interfaces small and focused
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations

They're important because they:
- Make code more maintainable
- Reduce technical debt
- Make systems easier to understand and extend
- Promote loose coupling

### 2. How would you explain the Single Responsibility Principle to a junior developer?
**Answer:** Imagine you're writing a class that handles user data. Instead of creating one massive class that handles validation, database operations, and email notifications, break it into separate classes:
- UserValidator: Handles validation
- UserRepository: Handles database operations
- NotificationService: Handles notifications

This makes each class:
- Easier to understand
- Easier to test
- Easier to modify without affecting other functionality

### 3. What's the difference between Open/Closed and Single Responsibility principles?
**Answer:**
- SRP focuses on giving a class one reason to change
- OCP focuses on how to add new functionality
- SRP is about organization and clarity
- OCP is about extensibility and maintenance

### 4. How do you identify violations of the Liskov Substitution Principle?
**Answer:** Look for:
- Subtypes that throw unexpected exceptions
- Subtypes that add extra preconditions
- Base class methods that don't make sense in subtypes
- Type checking in methods (if instanceof)
- Empty or stub implementations

### 5. Can you provide an example of Interface Segregation Principle violation?
**Answer:** A common violation is creating a "god interface" like:

```java
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
    void sleep();
    void calculateSalary();
    void fileReport();
}
```

Better to split into:
```java
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Feedable {
    void eat();
}

interface Payable {
    void calculateSalary();
}
```

### 6. How does Dependency Inversion relate to Dependency Injection?
**Answer:**
- DIP is the principle (depend on abstractions)
- DI is a pattern that helps achieve DIP
- DI is one way to implement DIP
- DIP tells you what to do
- DI tells you how to do it

### Best Practices
1. Start with SRP when refactoring
2. Use interfaces to achieve OCP
3. Test LSP through unit tests
4. Keep interfaces focused (ISP)
5. Use DI frameworks for DIP
6. Document violations when necessary
7. Consider SOLID during code reviews

### Common Pitfalls
1. Over-engineering simple solutions
2. Creating too many classes/interfaces
3. Violating principles in test code
4. Focusing on principles over practical needs
5. Not considering performance implications

Remember: SOLID principles are guidelines, not rules. Use them wisely and pragmatically based on your specific context and requirements.

## SOLID Principles in Python Context

### Key Differences from Static Languages

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Still fully applicable in Python
- Python's dynamic nature and duck typing make it easier to refactor and split responsibilities
- Use of modules and packages can help enforce SRP at a higher level
- Example:
```python
# Bad - Multiple responsibilities
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def validate(self):
        # Validation logic
        pass
    
    def save_to_db(self):
        # Database operations
        pass
    
    def send_email(self):
        # Email sending logic
        pass

# Good - Separated responsibilities
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

class UserValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def validate(user):
        # Validation logic
        pass

class UserRepository:
    @staticmethod
    def save(user):
        # Database operations
        pass

class EmailService:
    @staticmethod
    def send_email(user):
        # Email sending logic
        pass
```

2. **Open/Closed Principle**
- Python's dynamic nature and monkey patching can make OCP less strict
- Use abstract base classes (abc module) or protocols (Python 3.8+) for more formal interfaces
- Duck typing often naturally supports extension without modification
- Example:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        # Process credit card payment

class PayPalPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        # Process PayPal payment

# New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code
```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
- Python's duck typing makes LSP less rigid but still important
- Type hints (Python 3.5+) can help enforce LSP
- Runtime type checking is less common in Python
- Example:
```python
from typing import Protocol

class Bird(Protocol):
    def fly(self) -> None: ...

class Sparrow:
    def fly(self) -> None:
        print("Sparrow flying")

class Penguin:
    # Instead of forcing fly() implementation
    def swim(self) -> None:
        print("Penguin swimming")
```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**
- Python doesn't have explicit interfaces
- Use Protocol classes (Python 3.8+) or abstract base classes
- Duck typing naturally encourages interface segregation
- Example:
```python
from typing import Protocol

class Workable(Protocol):
    def work(self) -> None: ...

class Eatable(Protocol):
    def eat(self) -> None: ...

class Worker:
    def work(self) -> None:
        print("Working")

# Classes only need to implement the methods they use
```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
- Python's dynamic nature makes DIP less formal
- Use dependency injection through constructor or method parameters
- Type hints can help document dependencies
- Example:
```python
from typing import Protocol

class MessageSender(Protocol):
    def send(self, message: str) -> None: ...

class EmailSender:
    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")

class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, sender: MessageSender):
        self.sender = sender

    def notify(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.sender.send(message)
```

### Key Similarities

1. **Core Principles Still Apply**
- All SOLID principles remain valuable for code organization
- Help maintain clean, maintainable, and extensible code
- Guide architectural decisions regardless of language

2. **Benefits**
- Reduced coupling
- Easier testing
- Better maintainability
- More reusable code

3. **Best Practices in Python**
- Use composition over inheritance
- Leverage Python's built-in features (ABC, Protocols, type hints)
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Use dependency injection when appropriate

### Python-Specific Considerations

1. **Duck Typing**
- Reduces need for explicit interfaces
- Makes code naturally more flexible
- Still important to maintain consistent interfaces

2. **Type Hints**
- Optional but helpful for SOLID principles
- Document expected interfaces
- Help catch violations at development time

3. **Dynamic Nature**
- More flexibility in implementation
- Easier to refactor and modify
- Requires more discipline to maintain SOLID principles

Remember: While Python's dynamic nature provides more flexibility, following SOLID principles still leads to better code organization and maintainability. The implementation may be less rigid than in static languages, but the underlying concepts remain valuable.
