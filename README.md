# Design Principles

This repository provides an overview of important design principles that every engineer should know. Understanding and applying these design principles can significantly contribute to creating high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

## SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Other Design Principles

1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle
2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle
3. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) Principle
4. Composition Over Inheritance Principle
5. Law of Demeter (LoD) or Principle of Least Knowledge
6. Separation of Concerns (SoC)
7. High Cohesion and Low Coupling
8. GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)
9. Design by Contract (DbC)
10. Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)
11. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Please refer to each principle for a detailed explanation and guidelines on their application.
